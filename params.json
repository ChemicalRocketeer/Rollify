Have a magic device that uses your intelligence combined with your stamina to damage the enemy for a percentage of his mana, while also draining your power points? Rollify will calculate everything for you at the touch of a button. Need to combine multiple checks? No problem. Rollify's flexible system adapts to your game and your play style.\r\n\r\n### Coming soon\r\nRollify is in development. Check back soon for more information, or check out the GitHub page to contribute!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDavid Aaron Suddjian (@chemicalrocketeer)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
